## 🔑 How It Works <a name="how-it-works"></a>

1. 📍 To locate the GloEdge lead board you'll need to click on the Lead Board icon on your contractor main dashboard.

GloEdge is where leads **generated by our business outreach pipeline** appear. These aren't just cold inquiries—they’re **pre-qualified homeowners** who’ve shared their:

- ✅ **Budget range**
- ✅ **Project description**
- ✅ **Target installation timeframe**

Once a lead enters GloEdge:

- Every **contractor in the lead's area** gets notified.
- It's first-come, first-serve—whoever claims it **secures the connection**.
- After claiming, the lead drops straight into your **Internal Customers** inside GloDesk CRM, tagged as a **GloEdge Lead**.

You'll be notified **instantly** when a lead becomes available:

- We send an **email** to the address on your account.
- Make sure to whitelist `no-reply@gloquest.app` so your alerts don't end up in spam.
- Leads don’t stick around. **Most are claimed in under 10 minutes.**

## 🎯 Don’t Miss Out <a name="dont-miss-out"></a>

GloEdge leads disappear fast—sometimes within minutes. Waiting could mean missing your next **$3,000 holiday install**. If you see an opportunity, **claim it immediately** and follow up before someone else does.

⚠️ **Important:** This is **not a bidding system.**  
The first contractor to claim the lead gets it—**exclusively.** Once claimed, no one else will have access to contact that lead.
