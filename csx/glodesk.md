## 👥 Internal vs External Customers <a name="internal-vs-external"></a>

**Internal Customers** are leads you've claimed from **GloEdge**—automatically added to your CRM and tagged as **GloEdge Lead**.

**External Customers** are ones _you_ add manually—like past clients, referrals, or folks from social media. You’ll notice more control here:

- ✅ Edit contact info, tags, and notes
- ✅ Remove outdated contacts
- ✅ Use Smart Tags like **Contract Signed**, **Repeat Client**, and more

To add a new external customer, switch to the **External** tab and tap ➕ **Add Customer**.

If you don’t see the button, you're probably still in the Internal tab. Just switch over.

## 🔍 Tagging, Search & Filtering <a name="tagging-and-search"></a>

Quickly search by **name, phone number, tags, email, or even the date** they were added.  
Keep your list clean and actionable with custom labels that help you sort fast.

Use tags like:

- ✨ **Pending Response**
- 🔁 **Repeat Client**
- ✅ **Contract Signed**

Smart tagging gives you a real-time overview of your pipeline—and makes follow-ups a breeze.
