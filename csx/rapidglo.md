## 🎮 Controls Overview <a name="controls-overview"></a>

Here’s where the magic happens—no wand required. Your tools are grouped into four intuitive zones:

---

### 🌗 Day/Night Mode

- Toggle between day and night scenes.
- Night mode gives your lights that dramatic “wow” factor.
- Useful when you want to show off your mockup at its full holiday glory.

### 📏 Measuring Tools

- Drop a reference (like a door) to auto-scale your layout.
- Use the **Dial-In Tool** for real-world footage without climbing anything.
- Precision without a tape measure? We call that installer magic.

- ↩️ **Undo / Redo** — Mistake? Change of heart? These have your back.
- 👀 **Preview** — Instantly see your mockup without distractions.
- ❌ **New** — Start a new mockup without returning to the dashboard.
- 🔙 **Back** — This is your exit ramp. Tap it to return to the main dashboard anytime.

> 🔁 These buttons are designed to keep your workflow snappy and frustration-free.
