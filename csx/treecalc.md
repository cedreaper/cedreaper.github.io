## 🌳 Quick Tree/Bush Coverage Calculator

Math in the yard? No thanks. That’s why we built the **Tree & Bush Coverage Calculator**—a FREE tool that does the hard part for you.

- **Tree Wrap Mode**

  - Input: circumference of the trunk, tree height, strand spacing, and strand length.
  - Output: total feet of lights + exact number of strands you’ll need.
  - No more guessing, no more “I think it’s about six rolls.”

- **Bush Mode**
  - Input: bush height, coverage type (Fuller or Lighter), and lights per strand.
  - Output: total bulbs + strands required.
  - Works whether you’re covering a boxwood hedge or the monster bush in front of Mrs. Johnson’s window.
