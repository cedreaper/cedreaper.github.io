✅ **Make sure you hit Save Auto-Reply and you’re all set!** Leads will get your first-touch message immediately—no missed opportunities.

### 💡 Pro Tips for Crafting Your Message:

- Greet them by your business name to personalize the message.
- Set clear expectations (e.g., “Our minimum fee for installs is $1000.”).
- Add personality—fun, seasonal greetings work great.
- Ask if they’d like a free estimate or have timing preferences.
- Be authentic—the sky's the limit!

🔔 **Did you know?** When a lead replies, it routes straight to your inbox. You'll continue the conversation from there. _(We'll cover inbox management next.)_

#### 🤖 Auto Lead Capture <a name="auto-lead-capture"></a>

Want leads to land directly in your inbox while you're out in the field? Auto Lead Capture makes it simple. Here’s how to set it up:

---

### 1️⃣ Add Your Business Logo & Generate a QR Code

You can personalize your lead capture form and QR code with your own business logo.

- Paste a **logo image link** (public image URL) into the logo field. This will appear on your form and QR code preview.
- Your unique **QR code** will update instantly and can be shared anywhere: on yard signs, trucks, business cards, your social media or flyers.

Settings screen:

![QR Code Settings](../../assets/images/gloagent/gloAgentQrLeadLogo.png)

Example of the lead form preview with where your logo will appear if set:

![QR Code Preview](../../assets/images/gloagent/gloAgentFormLogo.png)

You'll see a **preview link** above your QR code, such as:
https://www.gloquest.app/u/99

The number at the end (**99** in this example) is your **personal form ID**. It ensures any submissions from your form route straight to your inbox.

---

### 2️⃣ Share Your Form Link or Embed It

Now share your form with the world and let GloAgent take care of qualifying and reaching out to the lead automatically to keep your company's lead pipeline running at max capacity:

- Copy the **direct link** to your form using the "Copy" button in the GloAgent settings.
- If you're comfortable and technically inclined you can also embed the form on your website using the code below, if you can't figure it out we're glad to help, just send us a report in app or email us any time at <a href="mailto:support@gloquest.app">support@gloquest.app</a>.

```html
<iframe src="https://www.gloquest.app/u/YOUR_FORM_ID" width="100%" height="600">
</iframe>
```

---

#### 📊 Usage <a name="usage"></a>

The **Lead Capture Hub** is where all of your form-based leads drop in. Anytime a customer fills out your personalized qualifying lead form (from your QR code, website embed, or shared link), you'll see them appear here.

You'll get a snapshot of:

- The customer's **budget range** and **preferred install timeframe**
- Their **name**, **phone number**, and **address** (if collected)
- A quick link to **add them to your CRM** for future automations and smart follow-ups

## 📬 Inbox & Messaging <a name="inbox--messaging"></a>

The **Messaging & Follow-Ups** area is your real-time conversation inbox. Think of it like your business text messages—except now, they're all organized in one place and directly tied to your leads.

What you'll find here:

- ✅ Full message history, just like your phone's text inbox
- ✅ Instant replies when customers text back from your auto-reply
- ✅ Send replies from within
- ✅ A clean view of open conversations and resolved chats

#### 📣 Mass Texts & Follow-Ups <a name="mass-text-followup"></a>

Need to message all your customers at once or schedule automated follow-ups? You’re in the right place. Whether you’re promoting seasonal specials, sending reminders, or following up with leads, Messaging & Follow-Ups helps you reach everyone quickly. Add your contacts from GloDesk™ CRM for easy one-click messaging, or enter numbers directly if they aren’t in your CRM yet. Plus, with follow-up sequences, you can automate your outreach—keeping your business top of mind without lifting a finger.

> **📜 Note:** U.S. law requires us to collect your customer’s permission before sending promotional texts. We’ll attempt to capture consent automatically on your first outgoing message—but the most cost-effective way is to ask them to pre-consent using [this opt-in form](https://www.gloquest.app/sms-opt-in.html) which they can access without ever making account or signing in. Otherwise, your first message will be used just to request permission.

---

## ✉️ Send Mass Texts

The **Messaging & Follow-Ups** screen lets you quickly reach one or multiple recipients:

- Add **existing contacts** from your **GloDesk™ CRM** with one click using the **"Add Existing Contacts"** button.

  > 💡 **Pro Tip:** Storing your customers in **GloDesk™ CRM** makes messaging faster and easier. Plus, it’s free—and helps keep your business organized. Your contact data stays secure and ready whenever you need it.

- Prefer to message someone not in your CRM yet? Just enter their phone numbers, separated by commas:<br/>
  Example: `4055991234, 4058771025`

- Pick a **message preset** from our growing library, or type your own custom message.  
  _(Have an idea for a new preset? Send us a feature request—we're always adding more!)_

## 🔄 Manage Follow-Up Sequences

Click **Manage Follow-Up Sequences** to schedule future messages to keep your leads warm.

You’ll be able to:

- Select a **preset sequence**, or build your own from scratch.
- Add multiple steps, setting how many days to wait between each message.
- Review all **pending follow-ups** and cancel any you no longer need (for example, if the customer already responded).

Follow-up management is flexible—if you close the deal after the first message, you can stop the rest in one tap.

## ❓ FAQs

<a name="faqs"></a>

## 🤔 Why isn't my auto-reply sending for every message?

Great question! Your auto-reply is only sent on **the first message from a new lead**. We designed it
this way to avoid spamming your existing customers every time they send a
message through the app. Otherwise, you'd end up re-sending the same intro
message over and over—and burning through your SMS credits like it's holiday
light season 🎄😅. We're doing you a solid.
