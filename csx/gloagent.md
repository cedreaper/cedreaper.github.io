### 💡 Pro Tips for Crafting Your Message:

- Greet them by your business name to personalize the message.
- Set clear expectations (e.g., “Our minimum for installs is $500.”).
- Add personality—fun, seasonal greetings work great.
- Ask if they’d like a free estimate or have timing preferences.
- Be authentic—the sky's the limit!
