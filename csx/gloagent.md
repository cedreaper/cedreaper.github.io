✅ **Make sure you hit Save Auto-Reply and you’re all set!** Leads will get your first-touch message immediately—no missed opportunities.

### 💡 Pro Tips for Crafting Your Message:

- Greet them by your business name to personalize the message.
- Set clear expectations (e.g., “Our minimum fee for installs is $1000.”).
- Add personality—fun, seasonal greetings work great.
- Ask if they’d like a free estimate or have timing preferences.
- Be authentic—the sky's the limit!

🔔 **Did you know?** When a lead replies, it routes straight to your inbox. You'll continue the conversation from there. _(We'll cover inbox management next.)_

### 🤖 Auto Lead Capture <a name="auto-lead-capture"></a>

Want leads to land directly in your inbox while you're out in the field? Auto Lead Capture makes it simple. Here’s how to set it up:

---

#### 1️⃣ Add Your Business Logo & Generate a QR Code

You can personalize your lead capture form and QR code with your own business logo.

- Paste a **logo image link** (public image URL) into the logo field. This will appear on your form and QR code preview.
- Your unique **QR code** will update instantly and can be shared anywhere: on yard signs, trucks, or flyers.

Settings screen:

Example of the lead form preview with where your logo will appear if set:

![QR Code Preview](../../assets/images/gloagent/gloAgentFormLogo.png)

You'll see a **preview link** above your QR code, such as:
https://www.gloquest.app/u/99

The number at the end (**99** in this example) is your **personal form ID**. It ensures any submissions from your form route straight to your inbox.

---

#### 2️⃣ Share Your Form Link or Embed It

Now share your form with the world and let GloAgent take care of qualifying and reaching out to the lead automatically to keep your lead pipeline running at max capacity:

- Copy the **direct link** to your form using the "Copy" button in the GloAgent settings.
- If you're comfortable and technically inclined you can also embed the form on your website using the code below:

````html
<iframe
  src="https://www.gloquest.app/u/YOUR_FORM_ID"
  width="100%"
  height="600"
></iframe>

<a name="faqs"></a>

### 🤔 Why isn't my auto-reply sending for every message? Great question! Your
auto-reply is only sent on **the first message from a new lead**. We designed it
this way to avoid spamming your existing customers every time they send a
message through the app. Otherwise, you'd end up re-sending the same intro
message over and over—and burning through your SMS credits like it's holiday
light season 🎄😅. We're doing you a solid. --- _(More questions coming soon:
