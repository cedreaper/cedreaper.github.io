## 🎯 Start with Credits: Fuel for the Tools

GloQuest runs on a **credits-based system.** While many features are completely free, the real power—the kind that **wins high-ticket jobs**—comes from unlocking advanced tools.

**Credits unlock:**

- AI-powered mockups
- Instant lead claiming
- Precision measurements
- Pro-level features like SnapLine and Decor Packs

Contractors who load up early gain a **competitive edge**, save more, and avoid the last-minute scramble.

Here’s how to stock up and save:

- 🟡 **Like & Follow Us on Facebook**  
  👉 [**facebook.com/GloQuest-Official**](https://www.facebook.com/p/GloQuest-Official-61566457803398/) 👈  
  Don’t leave free credits on the table — we post giveaways, flash contests, and insider tips you won’t want to miss. Seriously, folks have racked up credits just by watching our timeline.

- 💰 **Buy Credits in the App**  
  The best deals happen **before peak season hits.** Buying early = more tools, more savings.

- ⚡ **Watch for Flash Sales**  
  We occasionally drop surprise sales with bonus credits—usually when you least expect it.

> 🔥 **Pro Tip:** Waiting too long can cost you opportunities. The sooner you stock credits, the sooner you unlock tools that help land high-ticket installs. Most pros don’t wait—neither should you.

## 🤝 Earn Unlimited Credits: Referral Program

Want free credits? Share your **Referral Link** (you’ll find it at the bottom of your dashboard screen) and invite other contractors.

For every legitimate referral:

- They sign up → **You earn credits.**
- No limits. No cap. Just pure upside.

**Pro Tip:** Contractors who post their referral link in **Christmas light installer groups on Facebook** or **installer chats** often earn **hundreds—or even thousands—of credits** before peak season.

## 🌟 Stand Out: Activate Your Spotlight

Want to be the first installer clients see?

**Installer Spotlight** puts you in front of everyone browsing your area — even if they don’t request a quote. That means more direct messages, more visibility, and more high-ticket jobs.

- 📅 Runs for 30 days
- 🔑 Just 10 credits (best value)
- ⚠️ Limited slots per state

Don’t wait until it’s too late. Visit the Spotlight tab in the app.
