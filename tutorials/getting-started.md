## 🎯 Start with Credits: Fuel for the Tools

GloQuest runs on a **credits-based system.** Many features are **completely free**, but advanced tools like AI mockups, premium lead claiming, and instant measurements require credits.

Here’s how to stock up and save:

- 👍 **Like & Follow our Facebook page**  
  You’ll find free credit giveaways, contests, and pro tips to help you succeed.

- 💰 **Buy Credits in the App**  
  The best rates are during **pre-season**, so stocking up early gives you more mileage for your money.

- ⚡ **Watch for Flash Sales**  
  From time to time, we’ll run flash sales where you can scoop up extra credits at a discount.

## 🤝 Earn Unlimited Credits: Referral Program

Want to unlock premium features **without spending a dime?** Share your **Referral Link** (you’ll find it at the bottom of your dashboard screen) and invite other contractors.

For every legitimate referral:

- They sign up → **You earn credits.**
- No limits. No cap. Just pure upside.

**Pro Tip:** We’ve seen the best results when users post their referral link in **Christmas light installer groups on Facebook and other social circles.**  
Some contractors have earned **thousands of credits**, covering all their pre-season costs.

Start sharing in the places where other pros hang out and watch your credits pile up.
